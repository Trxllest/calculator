# A simple calculator

## In conclusion of The Odin Projects foundation course I created a calculator as the final project

## The main purpose was to combine what I learned in CSS HTML and JavaScript

## Other areas of focus:
- Git branching
- Git Merging
- Functions
- DOM Manipulation and events

### A live preview of the calculator can be found [here](https://trxllest.github.io/calculator/).
